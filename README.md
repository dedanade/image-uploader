<h1>Image Uploader <h1>

Created a simple page with React app that those the following:

* Uploads  images
*  Sends the file to Cloudinary to upload with the help of the Cloudinary API
*  Display the image uploaded and a link from the Cloudinary response.

Having previously built another platform with a similar process, my experience building this was smooth.
