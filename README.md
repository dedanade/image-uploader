<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Created a simple page with React app that those the following:

<ul>
<li>Uploads images</>
<li>Sends the file to Cloudinary to upload with the help of the Cloudinary API</li>
<li>Display the image uploaded and a link from the Cloudinary response</li>
</ul>
Having previously built another platform with a similar process, my experience building this was smooth.
